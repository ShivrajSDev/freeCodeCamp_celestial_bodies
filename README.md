# freeCodeCamp - Celestial Bodies Database Project

This is one of the projects that requires completion as part of [freeCodeCamp's Relational Database Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/).

As part of the [project's requirements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-celestial-bodies-database-project/build-a-celestial-bodies-database), this repository includes a universe.sql file that creates a PostgreSQL database that passed the required tests.
